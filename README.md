# Spark
A collection of mostly scala code that I have written for various projects involving Apache Spark. For one large-scale project, I used Spark for 90% of the ETL pipeline that involved multiple disparate, structured, unstructured, multi-terabyte data sources.

## Zeppelin
For some of the scala scripts, I installed and integrated Zeppelin servers to integrate with the existing Spark cluster.
